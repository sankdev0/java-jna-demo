# java-jna-demo
a demo project that shows an example use of JNA (Java Native Access)

Java Native Access (JNA)
========================

JNA provides Java programs easy access to native shared libraries without writing anything but Java code - no JNI or native code is required. This functionality is comparable to Windows' Platform/Invoke and Python's ctypes.

JNA allows you to call directly into native functions using natural Java method invocation. The Java call looks just like the call does in native code. Most calls require no special handling or configuration; no boilerplate or generated code is required.

Many projects make use of JNA. For further information and use cases look in [official JNA page](https://github.com/java-native-access/jna)
